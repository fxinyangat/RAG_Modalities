Currently, the U nited States  and its allies impose export controls on major \nsystems necessary for semiconductor manufacturing, but do not control many of the component sub- systems.  \nAlign Protection Measures Globally  \nAmerica must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies. We should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to a chieve greater international \nalignment.  \nRecommended Policy Actions  \n• Led by DOC and DOS and in coordination with NSC, DOE, and NSF, develop, implement, and share information on complementary technology protection measures, including in basic research and higher education, to mitigate risks from strategic adversaries and AMERICA ’S AI ACTION PLAN  \n22 con', 'le also delivering a reliable and affordable power grid for all Americans.  \nRestore American Semiconductor Manufacturing  \nAmerica jump -started modern technology with the invention of the semiconductor. Now \nAmerica must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to U.S. soil. A revitalized U.S. chip industry will generate thousands of high- paying jobs, reinforce our technological leadership, \nand protect our supply chains from disruption by foreign rivals. The Trump Administration will \nlead that revitalization without making bad deals for the American taxpayer or saddling \ncompanies with sweeping ideological agendas.  \nRecommended Policy Actions  \n• Led by DOC’s revamped CHIPS Program Office, continue focusing on delivering a strong return on investment for the American taxpayer and removing all extraneous policy requirements for CHIPS -funded semiconductor manufacturing projects. DOC \nand other relevant Federal agencies should also collaborate to streamline regulations that slow semi']
